      <title>Kyuubi Project Improvement Proposals (KPIP)</title>
      <link>https://www.turbofei.wang/improvement-proposals.html</link>

      <guid>https://www.turbofei.wang/improvement-proposals.html</guid>
      <description>The purpose of a KBIP is to inform and involve the user community in significant improvements to the Kyuubi codebase throughout the development process to increase user needs.
KBIPs should be used for significant user-facing or cross-cutting changes, not minor incremental improvements. When in doubt, if a committer thinks a change needs a KBIP, it does.
What is a KBIP? A KBIP is similar to a product requirement document commonly used in product management.</description>

      <title>Kyuubi Usage</title>
      <link>https://www.turbofei.wang/usage.html</link>

      <description>Kyuubi provides a pure SQL gateway through Thrift JDBC/ODBC interface for end-users to manipulate large-scale data with pre-programmed and extensible Spark SQL engines.
We are aiming to make Kyuubi an &amp;ldquo;out-of-the-box&amp;rdquo; tool for data warehouses and data lakes.
This &amp;ldquo;out-of-the-box&amp;rdquo; model minimizes the barriers and costs for end-users to use Spark at the client side.
At the server-side, Kyuubi server and engines&#39; multi-tenant architecture provides the administrators a way to achieve computing resource isolation, data security, high availability, high client concurrency, etc.</description>

./build/mvn clean package -DskipTests This results in the creation of all sub-modules of Kyuubi project without running any unit test.
If you want to test it manually, you can start Kyuubi directly from the Kyuubi project root by running
bin/kyuubi start Building a Submodule Individually For instance, you can build the Kyuubi Common module using:
