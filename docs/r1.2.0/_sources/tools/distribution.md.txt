# Building a Runnable Distribution

To create a Kyuubi distribution like those distributed by [Kyuubi Release Page](https://github.com/NetEase/kyuubi/releases),
and that is laid out so as to be runnable, use `./build/dist` in the project root directory.

For more information on usage, run `./build/dist --help`

```logtalk
./build/dist - Tool for making binary distributions of Kyuubi Server

Usage:
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ./build/dist [--name <custom_name>] [--tgz] [--spark-provided] <maven build options> |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
name:           -  custom binary name, using project version if undefined
tgz:            -  whether to make a whole bundled package
spark-provided: -  whether to make a package without Spark binary
```

For instance,

```bash
./build/dist --name custom-name --tgz
```

This results a Kyuubi distribution named `kyuubi-{version}-bin-custom-name.tar.gz` for you.

If you are planing to deploy Kyuubi where `spark` is provided, in other word, it's not required to bundle spark binary, use 

```bash
./build/dist --tgz --spark-provided
```

Then you will get a Kyuubi distribution without spark binary named `kyuubi-{version}-bin-without-spark.tar.gz`.
