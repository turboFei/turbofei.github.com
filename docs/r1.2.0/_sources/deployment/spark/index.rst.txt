The Engine Configuration Guide
==============================

Kyuubi aims to bring Spark to end-users who need not qualify with Spark or something else related to the big data area.
End-users can write SQL queries through JDBC against Kyuubi and nothing more.
The Kyuubi server-side or the corresponding engines could do most of the optimization.
On the other hand, we don't wholly restrict end-users to special handling of specific cases to benefit from the following documentations.
Even if you don't use Kyuubi, as a simple Spark user, I'm sure you'll find the next articles instructive.
